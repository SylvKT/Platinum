# FAQ
- Q: Is this game engine for me?
	- A: That's for you to decide, not me.
- Q: Will there be support for other languages?
	- A: Eventually, yes.
- Q: Why does this exist?
	- A: I got bored.
- Q: When will 3D support be added?
	- A: Probably in mid to late alpha or early beta. This project isn't even in its alpha stage yet, so it'll be a while.
- Q: Why isn't there linux/windows support yet?
	- A: Currently, I'm in need of contributors who have those operating systems and are willing to test the build scripts on each operating system. I'll get around to doing it myself, but it'll be quicker if there are such contributors.
